# Capacity-Optimization
This Project will help in those areas where the outgoing and incoming of people is more than the total capacity , For example If in a Mess the total capacity is 800 and there are 1000 students enrolled to that mess and due to infrastructure constraints one can not extend the capacity,We have designed a webapp that will let you know the real time person count data of the mess and will help you deciding the optimal time to go to the mess to avoid chaos and to save time.
